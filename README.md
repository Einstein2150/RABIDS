## Overview

**RABIDS** (Roving Autonomous Bartmoss Interface Drones) is a comprehensive framework for building custom offensive security payloads. It provides a powerful yet intuitive graphical interface to chain together various modules—such as ransomware, clipboard hijackers, and persistence loaders—into a single, compiled executable for Windows, Linux, or macOS.

This tool is designed for security researchers, red teamers, and educational purposes to simulate advanced adversaries and study malware behavior in a controlled environment.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install GUI Dependency:**

    The user interface requires `PyQt5` and `discord`. Install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install PyQt5 discord
    ```

2.  **Run the Application:**

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

## Features

- **Modular Payload Creation:** Chain multiple modules together to create sophisticated, multi-stage payloads.
- **Cross-Platform Compilation:** Build executables for Windows, Linux, and macOS, with support for both `amd64` and `arm64` architectures.
- **Optional Obfuscation:** Leverage a Dockerized Obfuscator-LLVM toolchain to apply advanced obfuscation techniques to Windows payloads.
- **Intuitive Graphical User Interface:** A clean and modern UI makes it easy to select modules, configure options, and build payloads without writing any code.
- **Standalone Tooling:** Includes dedicated tabs for building a file decryptor (`UNKRASH`) and a file restorer (`Garbage Collector`).
- **In-Memory Execution:** On Windows, payloads are wrapped in a Rust loader that executes the core Nim binary directly from memory, helping to evade basic static analysis.
- **Integrated C2:** A dedicated tab provides a Command & Control interface for interacting with the `ghostintheshell` reverse shell module.

## Payload Architecture

RABIDS payloads are constructed with a multi-language approach to maximize flexibility and evasiveness:

- **Core Logic (Nim):** The primary functionality of each module is written in Nim, a high-performance, statically-typed language that compiles to native C, C++, or JavaScript. This allows for fast, efficient, and dependency-free binaries.
- **Windows Wrapper (Rust):** For Windows targets, the compiled Nim payload is embedded within a Rust-based loader. This loader is responsible for executing the Nim binary directly from memory (`memexec`), which can bypass some filesystem-based security controls. The Rust wrapper also handles the embedding of necessary DLLs and other files, ensuring the final executable is self-contained.

## Available Modules

- **`ctrlvamp`**: Hijacks clipboard crypto addresses (BTC, ETH, BEP-20, SOL).
- **`dumpster`**: Collects files from a directory and archives them into a single file.
- **`ghostintheshell`**: Provides a reverse shell over Discord for remote access.
- **`krash`**: A ransomware module that encrypts files using AES and can report success via Discord.
- **`poof`**: Recursively deletes all files and folders from a target directory.
- **`undeleteme`**: Gains persistence and can add a Windows Defender exclusion.
- **`bankruptsys`**: An ATM malware module designed to dispense cash by interacting with the XFS middleware.
- **`winkrashv2`**: A stealthy ransomware module for Windows that uses direct syscalls for file operations to evade common API hooking.
- **`byovf`**: "Bring Your Own File" - A flexible module that allows you to embed your own Nim code and secondary files (like drivers or DLLs) into the payload.

## Documentation & Setup

All documentation, including detailed installation instructions, setup guides, and in-depth module descriptions, can be found within the application itself under the **"DOCUMENTATION" tab**.

This in-app guide provides everything you need to know to:

- Install dependencies (Python, Nim, Rust, Docker).
- Configure build options.
- Understand each module and its parameters.
- Build and find your payloads.
